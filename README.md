# Predictive Model Project

This repository contains a predictive model built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The project allows users to analyze datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and apply predictive modeling techniques. 

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Predictive modeling using machine learning techniques
- Kaggle dataset integration

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/predictive-model.git
   cd predictive-model
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Predictive_Model.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Load your dataset (local or Kaggle integration).
   - Perform EDA to gain insights into your data.
   - Train and evaluate predictive models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Kaggle API for dataset integration
